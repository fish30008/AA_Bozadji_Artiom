### Short desccription of algorithm: 
This code defines a strategy for a decision-making game where it returns 1 (cooperate) or 0 (defect) based on patterns in the opponent's past actions and the player's own recent moves, aiming to detect and respond to consistent defection or specific behavior patterns. Additionaly this algorithm is always deffect and trying to trick the oponents algorithm with not random coopearations, based on other algorithms history.
